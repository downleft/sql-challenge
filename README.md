# sql-challenge
This challenge is set up to import and analyze data for a hypothetical company within SQL from six CSV files, in the EmployeeSQL folder.

An Entity Relationship Diagram is first set up using QuickDBD in order to show the relationships across the six files.  This diagram is also in the EmployeeSQL folder.

From there, open the sql_challenge.sql.  To create the tables, run the CREATE TABLE code in the order that the code is written.

From there, import the data from the CSV files into the database tables in the same order that the tables were created.

Finally, data is selected and joins are performed in the order that the code is written, beginning with line 68 of the code.
