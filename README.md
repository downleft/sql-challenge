# sql-challenge
This challenge is set up to import and analyze data for a hypothetical company within SQL from six CSV files, in the EmployeeSQL folder.

An Entity Relationship Diagram is first set up using QuickDBD in order to show the relationships across the six files.  This diagram is also in the EmployeeSQL folder.

From there, open the table_schemata.sql file to create the tables.  Run the CREATE TABLE code in the order that the code is written.

From there, import the data from the CSV files into the database tables in the same order that the tables were created.

For the data analysis, open the data_analysis.sql file. Use this to select data and perform appropriate joins in the order that the code is written.
